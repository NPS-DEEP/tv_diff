"""Settings are kept in the user's home directory in
file .tv_threshold_settings.  Access them using this manager.

Provides the following services:
  Global variables, do not directly change their values.
     settings - the active settings
     default_settings
  Note: settings is global and also signal_settings_changed provides settings.

  Class SettingsManager, provides methods to safely change and notify settings:
     copy() - get your copy of settings
     change(provided settings) - change provided settings values, signal change
     _load(), load_from() - change all settings values from file, signal change
     _save(), save_to(fname), save settings to user default file or named file

Usage:
  Use SettingsManager to initialize or modify the global settings variable.
  SettingsManager is a singleton because it manages the settings resource.
  Instantiate SettingsManager before relying on settings values.
  Listen to the signal_settings_changed signal if you need to respond to change.
  Access the settings global variable without needing SettingsManager.
